                   Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Institute of Space
                   and Astronautical Science (ISAS/JAXA) was
                   successfully launched in September 2006. As the
                   successor to the Yohkoh mission, it aims to
                   understand how magnetic energy gets transferred from
                   the photosphere to the upper atmosphere and results
                   in explosive energy releases. Hinode is an
                   observatory style mission, with all the instruments
                   being designed and built to work together to address
                   the science aims. There are three instruments
                   onboard: the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT), the EUV
                   Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), and the X-Ray Telescope
                   (XRT). This paper provides an overview of the
                   mission, detailing the satellite, the scientific
                   payload, and operations. It will conclude with
                   discussions on how the international science
                   community can participate in the analysis of the
                   mission data.},

                   11 February 2010 at 15:23 UT from Kennedy Space
                   Center aboard an Atlas V 401 (AV-021) launch vehicle.
                   A series of apogee-motor firings lifted SDO from an
                   initial geosynchronous transfer orbit into a circular
                   geosynchronous orbit inclined by 28° about the
                   longitude of the SDO-dedicated ground station in New
                   Mexico. SDO began returning science data on 1 May
                   2010. SDO is the first space-weather mission in
                   NASA’s Living With a Star (LWS) Program. SDO’s
                   main goal is to understand, driving toward a
                   predictive capability, those solar variations that
                   influence life on Earth and humanity’s
                   technological systems. The SDO science investigations
                   will determine how the Sun’s magnetic field is
                   generated and structured, how this stored magnetic
                   energy is released into the heliosphere and geospace
                   as the solar wind, energetic particles, and
                   variations in the solar irradiance. Insights gained
                   from SDO investigations will also lead to an
                   increased understanding of the role that solar
                   variability plays in changes in Earth’s atmospheric
                   chemistry and climate. The SDO mission includes three
                   scientific investigations (the Atmospheric Imaging
                   Assembly (AIA), Extreme Ultraviolet Variability
                   Experiment (EVE), and Helioseismic and Magnetic
                   Imager (HMI)), a spacecraft bus, and a dedicated
                   ground station to handle the telemetry. The Goddard
                   Space Flight Center built and will operate the
                   spacecraft during its planned five-year mission life;
                   this includes: commanding the spacecraft, receiving
                   the science data, and forwarding that data to the
                   science teams. The science investigations teams at
                   Stanford University, Lockheed Martin Solar
                   Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL), and University of
                   Colorado Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics
                   (LASP) will process, analyze, distribute, and archive
                   the science data. We will describe the building of
                   SDO and the science that it will provide to NASA.},

                   observe solar corona and upper transition region
                   emission lines in the wavelength ranges 170 - 210 Å
                   and 250 - 290 Å. The line centroid positions and
                   profile widths will allow plasma velocities and
                   turbulent or non-thermal line broadenings to be
                   measured. We will derive local plasma temperatures
                   and densities from the line intensities. The spectra
                   will allow accurate determination of differential
                   emission measure and element abundances within a
                   variety of corona and transition region structures.
                   These powerful spectroscopic diagnostics will allow
                   identification and characterization of magnetic
                   reconnection and wave propagation processes in the
                   upper solar atmosphere. We will also directly study
                   the detailed evolution and heating of coronal loops.
                   The EIS instrument incorporates a unique two element,
                   normal incidence design. The optics are coated with
                   optimized multilayer coatings. We have selected
                   highly efficient, backside-illuminated, thinned CCDs.
                   These design features result in an instrument that
                   has significantly greater effective area than
                   previous orbiting EUV spectrographs with typical
                   active region 2 - 5 s exposure times in the brightest
                   lines. EIS can scan a field of 6×8.5 arc min with
                   spatial and velocity scales of 1 arc sec and 25 km
                   s-1 per pixel. The instrument design, its absolute
                   calibration, and performance are described in detail
                   in this paper. EIS will be used along with the Solar
                   Optical Telescope (SOT) and the X-ray Telescope (XRT)
                   for a wide range of studies of the solar atmosphere.},

                   This interpretation suggests that the X-ray corona is
                   created by the dissipation at the many tangential
                   discontinuities arising spontaneously in the bipolar
                   fields of the active regions of the sun as a
                   consequence of random continuous motion of the
                   footpoints of the field in the photospheric
                   convection. The quantitative characteristics of the
                   process are inferred from the observed coronal heat

                   instruments on Hinode and the Solar Dynamics
                   Observatory (SDO). These multi-instrument
                   observations allow us to determine the distribution
                   of plasma temperatures and follow the evolution of
                   emission at different temperatures. We find that at
                   the apex of the high-temperature loops the emission
                   measure distribution is strongly peaked near 4 MK and
                   falls off sharply at both higher and lower
                   temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the
                   emission measure at 0.5 MK is reduced by more than
                   two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK. We
                   also find that the temporal evolution in broadband
                   soft X-ray images is relatively constant over about 6
                   hr of observing. Observations in the cooler
                   SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) bandpasses
                   generally do not show cooling loops in the core of
                   the active region, consistent with the steady
                   emission observed at high temperatures. These
                   observations suggest that the high-temperature loops
                   observed in the core of an active region are close to
                   equilibrium. We find that it is possible to reproduce

                   lines with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario
                   where heating events occur on timescales much less
                   than a characteristic cooling time. In contrast,
                   low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly
                   invoked to describe nanoflare models of coronal
                   heating, do not reproduce the relative intensities of
                   high-temperature emission lines and predict

                   measurements of the temperature distribution in solar
                   active regions can finally be made. Such measurements
                   are critical for constraining theories of coronal
                   heating. Past analysis, however, has suffered from
                   limited sample sizes and large uncertainties at
                   temperatures between 5 and 10 MK. Here we present a
                   systematic study of the differential emission measure
                   distribution in 15 active region cores. We focus on
                   measurements in the inter-moss region, that is, the
                   region between the loop footpoints, where the
                   observations are easier to interpret. To reduce the
                   uncertainties at the highest temperatures we present
                   a new method for isolating the Fe XVIII emission in
                   the AIA/SDO 94 Å channel. The resulting differential
                   emission measure distributions confirm our previous
                   analysis showing that the temperature distribution in
                   an active region core is often strongly peaked near
                   4 MK. We characterize the properties of the emission
                   distribution as a function of the total unsigned
                   magnetic flux. We find that the amount of
                   high-temperature emission in the active region core
                   is correlated with the total unsigned magnetic flux,
                   while the emission at lower temperatures, in
                   contrast, is inversely related. These results provide
                   compelling evidence that high-temperature active
                   region emission is often close to equilibrium,
                   although weaker active regions may be dominated by
                   evolving million degree loops in the core.},

                   mechanisms. Observations indicate that the
                   intensities and velocities measured in active region
                   cores are effectively steady, suggesting that heating
                   events occur rapidly enough to keep high-temperature
                   active region loops close to equilibrium. In this
                   paper, we couple observations of active region (AR)
                   10955 made with the X-Ray Telescope and the EUV
                   Imaging Spectrometer on board Hinode to test a simple
                   steady heating model. First we calculate the
                   differential emission measure (DEM) of the apex
                   region of the loops in the active region core. We
                   find the DEM to be broad and peaked around 3 MK. We
                   then determine the densities in the corresponding
                   footpoint regions. Using potential field
                   extrapolations to approximate the loop lengths and
                   the density-sensitive line ratios to infer the
                   magnitude of the heating, we build a steady heating
                   model for the active region core and find that we can
                   match the general properties of the observed DEM for
                   the temperature range of 6.3 {\textless} log T
                   {\textless} 6.7. This model, for the first time,
                   accounts for the base pressure, loop length, and
                   distribution of apex temperatures of the core loops.
                   We find that the density-sensitive spectral line
                   intensities and the bulk of the hot emission in the
                   active region core are consistent with steady
                   heating. We also find, however, that the steady
                   heating model cannot address the emission observed at
                   lower temperatures. This emission may be due to
                   foreground or background structures, or may indicate
                   that the heating in the core is more complicated.
                   Different heating scenarios must be tested to
                   determine if they have the same level of agreement.},

                   individually. Rather, we concentrate on the

                   observations from the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer

                   measures contain clues to the time dependence of the
                   underlying heating mechanism. A strongly nonlinear
                   scaling of the emission measure with temperature
                   indicates a large amount of hot plasma relative to
                   warm plasma. A weakly nonlinear (or linear) scaling
                   of the emission measure indicates a relatively large
                   amount of warm plasma, suggesting that the hot active
                   region plasma is allowed to cool and so the heating
                   is impulsive with a long repeat time. This case is
                   called low-frequency nanoflare heating, and we
                   investigate its feasibility as an active region
                   heating scenario here. We explore a parameter space
                   of heating and coronal loop properties with a

                   low-frequency nanoflare heating is consistent with
                   about 36\% of observed active region cores when
                   uncertainties in the atomic data are not accounted
                   for; (2) proper consideration of uncertainties yields
                   a range in which as many as 77\% of observed active
                   regions are consistent with low-frequency nanoflare
                   heating and as few as zero; (3) low-frequency
                   nanoflare heating cannot explain observed slopes
                   greater than 3; (4) the upper limit to the volumetric
                   energy release is in the region of 50 erg cm-3 to
                   avoid unphysical magnetic field strengths; (5) the

                   regions can be studied by analyzing the slope of the
                   emission measure distribution coolward of the peak.
                   In a previous study we showed that low-frequency
                   heating can account for 0\% to 77\% of active region
                   core emission measures. We now turn our attention to
                   heating by a finite succession of impulsive events
                   for which the timescale between events on a single
                   magnetic strand is shorter than the cooling
                   timescale. We refer to this scenario as a "nanoflare
                   train" and explore a parameter space of heating and
                   coronal loop properties with a hydrodynamic model.
                   Our conclusions are (1) nanoflare trains are
                   consistent with 86\% to 100\% of observed active
                   region cores when uncertainties in the atomic data
                   are properly accounted for; (2) steeper slopes are
                   found for larger values of the ratio of the train
                   duration Δ H to the post-train cooling and draining
                   timescale Δ C , where Δ H depends on the number of
                   heating events, the event duration and the time
                   interval between successive events (τ C ); (3) τ C
                   may be diagnosed from the width of the hot component
                   of the emission measure provided that the temperature
                   bins are much smaller than 0.1 dex (4) the slope of
                   the emission measure alone is not sufficient to
                   provide information about any timescale associated
                   with heating—the length and density of the heated
                   structure must be measured for Δ H to be uniquely
                   extracted from the ratio Δ H /Δ C .},

                   of the EM slope in the 1-3 MK range within the core
                   of the AR using several methods, either from
                   approximations or from the differential emission
                   measure (DEM). A significant variation of the slope
                   is found at different spatial locations within the
                   active region. We selected two regions that were not
                   greatly affected by lower temperature emission along
                   the line of sight. We found that the EM had a power
                   law of the form EM ∝ Tb, with b = 4.4 ± 0.4, and
                   4.6 ± 0.4, during the first and second appearance of
                   the active region, respectively. During the second
                   rotation, line-of-sight effects become more
                   important, although difficult to estimate. We found
                   that the use of the ground calibration for Hinode/EIS
                   and the approximate method to derive the EM, used in
                   previous publications, produce an underestimation of
                   the slopes. The EM distribution in active region
                   cores is generally found to be consistent with high
                   frequency heating, and does not change much during

                   nanoflares), this indicates that a majority of the
                   component loop structures are in the radiatively
                   cooling phase of their lifecycle, and these motions
                   should not be used to verify the predictions of any
                   proposed theory of heating. However, the nature of
                   the bulk downflows raises the possibility that
                   enthalpy may play a key role in the energy balance of
                   the loops and in particular that it powers the

                   one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of loop
                   cooling to show that enthalpy losses from the corona
                   are easily sufficient to power the transition region

                   that downward thermal conduction powers the

                   between the transition region and the corona in terms
                   of temperature alone is then a grossly unphysical
                   simplification, and a proper definition of the
                   interface between these atmospheric layers requires a
                   detailed knowledge of their energy balance. To this
                   end, we propose a robust new definition of the

                   distribution of nanoflare energies is either
                   constant, randomly distributed, or a power law. Power

                   thus too long to account for the EM measurements.
                   Instead, it is suggested that a nanoflare involves
                   the relaxation from one stressed coronal state to
                   another, dissipating only a small fraction of the
                   available magnetic energy. A consequence is that

                   (named 'nanoflares' by Parker) is examined. A model
                   in which the closed, active region corona is
                   comprised of many hundred of small elemental flux
                   loops randomly heated by nanoflares is presentd. The
                   cooling of these flux loops is examined using
                   analytic techniques. It is assumed that the heated
                   loops cool initially by conduction and at later times
                   by radiation. Radiative cooling with and without
                   downward mass flows are discussed, the experimental
                   signature of such a coronal model are predicted. The
                   distribution of temperatures in these loops peaks at
                   around 2 x 106 K, while the distribution of densities
                   peaks above 1010/cu cm. For 2 x 105 K less than T
                   less than 106 K, radiative cooling with mass flows
                   gives an emission measure that scales as T1.5, in
                   agreement with existing observations. For T greater
                   than 106 K, the emission measure increases more
                   steeply, scaling as T4.5. These scalings are entirely
                   due to the temperature dependence of the radiative
                   loss function. It is shown that such a loop model has
                   filling factors (defined as the ratio of the volume
                   of hot plasma to the total volume) of order unity for
                   subarcsecond energy release scales. A brief survey of
                   the dependence of the results on the parameters of
                   the system is presented. The temperature distribution
                   function and emission measure are relatively
                   insensitive to the loop length, coronal energy loss,
                   number of elemental loops, and nanoflare energy, but
                   the filling factor is dependent on these quantities.
                   A simple scaling for this dependence is presented.},

                   considered a leading candidate to solve the coronal
                   heating problem. However, the frequent occurrence of
                   nanoflares requires that flare-hot plasma be present
                   in the corona at all times. Its detection has proved
                   elusive until now, in part because the intensities
                   are predicted to be very faint. Here, we report on
                   the analysis of an active region observed with five
                   filters by Hinode/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) in 2006
                   November. We have used the filter ratio method to
                   derive maps of temperature and emission measure (EM)
                   both in soft and hard ratios. These maps are
                   approximate in that the plasma is assumed to be
                   isothermal along each line of sight. Nonetheless, the
                   hardest available ratio reveals the clear presence of
                   plasma around 10 MK. To obtain more detailed
                   information about the plasma properties, we have
                   performed Monte Carlo simulations assuming a variety
                   of nonisothermal EM distributions along the lines of
                   sight. We find that the observed filter ratios imply
                   bi-modal distributions consisting of a strong cool
                   (log T {\textasciitilde} 6.3 - 6.5) component and a
                   weaker (few percent) and hotter (6.6 {\textless} log
                   T {\textless} 7.2) component. The data are consistent
                   with bi-modal distributions along all lines of sight,
                   i.e., throughout the active region. We also find that
                   the isothermal temperature inferred from a filter
                   ratio depends sensitively on the precise temperature
                   of the cool component. A slight shift of this
                   component can cause the hot component to be obscured
                   in a hard ratio measurement. Consequently,
                   temperature maps made in hard and soft ratios tend to
                   be anti-correlated. We conclude that this observation

                   consistent with nanoflare heating. The fluxes from 10
                   broadband X-ray filters and filter combinations were
                   used to construct differential emission measure (DEM)

                   peak at log T = 6.3-6.5, we find a high-temperature
                   component with significant emission measure at log T
                   {\textgreater} 7.0. This emission measure is weak
                   compared to the main peak—the DEM is down by almost
                   three orders of magnitude—which accounts of the
                   fact that it has not been observed with earlier

                   AIA imaging and EIS spectral data, including the Ca

                   cores is presented. Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer
                   (EIS) observations of strong iron spectral lines have
                   shown sharply peaked distributions around 3 MK. EIS
                   observations of lines emitted by a range of elements
                   have allowed good estimates of abundances relative to
                   iron. However, X-ray observations are required to
                   measure the plasma emission above 3 MK and the
                   abundances of oxygen and neon. We revisit, using
                   up-to-date atomic data, older X-ray observations
                   obtained by a sounding rocket and by the Solar
                   Maximum Mission (SMM) Flat Crystal Spectrometer

                   normally increased by a factor of 3.2, compared to
                   the photospheric values. Similar results are obtained
                   from FCS observations of six quiescent active region
                   cores. The FCS observations also indicate that the
                   emission measure above 3 MK has a very steep negative
                   slope, with very little plasma observed at 5 MK or

                   taking advantage of the complementary diagnostics
                   provided by the two instruments. In particular, we
                   want to explore the presence of hot plasma in
                   non-flaring regions. Independent temperature analyses
                   from the XRT multi-filter data set, and the EIS
                   spectra, including the instrument entire wavelength
                   range, provide a cross-check of the different
                   temperature diagnostics techniques applicable to
                   broadband and spectral data, respectively, and
                   insights into cross-calibration of the two
                   instruments. The emission measure distributions,
                   (EM(T)), we derive from the two data sets have
                   similar width and peak temperature, but show a
                   systematic shift of the absolute values, the EIS
                   (EM(T)) being smaller than the XRT (EM(T)) by
                   approximately a factor two. We explore possible
                   causes of this discrepancy, and we discuss the
                   influence of the assumptions for the plasma element
                   abundances. Specifically, we find that the
                   disagreement between the results from the two

                   chemical composition closer to the solar photospheric
                   composition rather than the often adopted "coronal"
                   composition. We find that the data do not provide
                   conclusive evidence on the high temperature (log T(K)
                   {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 6.5) tail of the

                   of EUV spectral data from Hinode Extreme-ultraviolet
                   Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; sensitive to temperatures

                   temperature structure of the observed plasma. In this
                   Letter, we demonstrate that a "blind spot" exists in
                   temperature-emission measure space for combined
                   Hinode EIS and XRT observations. For a typical active
                   region core with significant emission at 3-4 MK,
                   Hinode EIS and XRT are insensitive to plasma with
                   temperatures greater than {\textasciitilde}6 MK and
                   emission measures less than {\textasciitilde}1027

                   emission measure limits of this blind spot depend
                   upon the temperature distribution of the plasma along
                   the line of sight by considering a hypothetical
                   emission measure distribution sharply peaked at 1 MK.
                   For this emission measure distribution, we find that
                   EIS and XRT are insensitive to plasma with emission
                   measures less than {\textasciitilde}1026 cm-5. We
                   suggest that a spatially and spectrally resolved 6-24
                   Å spectrum would improve the sensitivity to these
                   high-temperature, low emission measure plasma.},

                   component has been diagnosed in solar active regions
                   through the images in three different narrow-band
                   channels of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on
                   board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This
                   diagnostic from extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging
                   data has also been supported by the matching
                   morphology of emission in the hot Ca XVII line, as
                   observed with Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging
                   Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode. This evidence is
                   debated because of the unknown distribution of the
                   emission measure along the line of sight. Here we
                   investigate in detail the thermal distribution of one
                   such region using EUV spectroscopic data. Methods: In
                   an active region observed with SDO/AIA, Hinode/EIS,
                   and X-ray telescope (XRT), we select a sub-region
                   with a very hot plasma component and another cooler
                   sub-region for comparison. The average spectrum is
                   extracted for both, and 14 intense lines are selected
                   for analysis that probe the 5.5 {\textless} log T
                   {\textless} 7 temperature range uniformly. From these
                   lines, the emission measure distributions are
                   reconstructed with the Markov-chain Monte Carlo
                   method. Results are cross-checked in comparison with
                   the two sub-regions, with a different inversion
                   method, with the morphology of the images, and with
                   the addition of fluxes measured with narrow, and
                   broadband imagers. Results: We find that, whereas the
                   cool region has a flat and featureless distribution
                   that drops at temperature log T ≥ 6.3, the
                   distribution of the hot region shows a well-defined
                   peak at log T = 6.6 and gradually decreasing trends
                   on both sides, thus supporting the very hot nature of
                   the hot component diagnosed with imagers. The other
                   cross-checks are consistent with this result.
                   Conclusions: This study provides a completion of the
                   analysis of active region components, and the
                   resulting scenario supports the presence of a minor
                   very hot plasma component in the core, with
                   temperatures log T {\textgreater} 6.6.},

  abstract =      {Aims: The detection of very hot plasma in the
                   quiescent corona is important for diagnosing heating
                   mechanisms. The presence and the amount of such hot
                   plasma is currently debated. The SphinX instrument
                   on-board the CORONAS-PHOTON mission is sensitive to
                   X-ray emission of energies well above 1 keV and
                   provides the opportunity to detect the hot plasma
                   component. Methods: We analysed the X-ray spectra of
                   the solar corona collected by the SphinX spectrometer
                   in May 2009 (when two active regions were present).
                   We modelled the spectrum extracted from the whole Sun
                   over a time window of 17 days in the 1.34-7 keV
                   energy band by adopting the latest release of the
                   APED database. Results: The SphinX broadband spectrum
                   cannot be modelled by a single isothermal component
                   of optically thin plasma and two components are
                   necessary. In particular, the high statistical
                   significance of the count rates and the accurate
                   calibration of the spectrometer allowed us to detect
                   a very hot component at {\textasciitilde}7 million K
                   with an emission measure of {\textasciitilde}2.7 ×
                   1044 cm-3. The X-ray emission from the hot plasma
                   dominates the solar X-ray spectrum above 4 keV. We
                   checked that this hot component is invariably present
                   in both the high and low emission regimes, i.e. even
                   excluding resolvable microflares. We also present and
                   discuss the possibility of a non-thermal origin
                   (which would be compatible with a weak contribution
                   from thick-target bremsstrahlung) for this hard
                   emission component. Conclusions: Our results support
                   the nanoflare scenario and might confirm that a minor
                   flaring activity is ever-present in the quiescent
                   corona, as also inferred for the coronae of other
                   stars.},

                   (MeV and GeV scales for electrons and ions,
                   respectively) through efficient acceleration
                   processes that are not currently understood. Hard
                   X-rays (HXRs) are the most direct diagnostic of
                   flare-accelerated electrons. However, past and
                   current solar HXR observers lack the necessary
                   sensitivity and imaging dynamic range to make
                   detailed studies of faint HXR sources in the solar
                   corona (where particle acceleration is thought to
                   occur); these limitations are mainly due to the
                   indirect Fourier imaging techniques used by these
                   observers. With greater sensitivity and dynamic
                   range, electron acceleration sites could be
                   systematically studied in detail. Both these
                   capabilities can be advanced by the use of direct
                   focusing optics. The recently own Focusing Optics
                   X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket payload
                   demonstrates the unique diagnostic power of focusing
                   optics for observations of solar HXRs. FOXSI features
                   grazing-incidence replicated nickel optics with 5
                   arcsecond resolution and fine-pitch silicon strip
                   detectors with a 7.7 arcsecond strip pitch. FOXSI
                   flew successfully on 2012 November 2, producing
                   images and spectra of a microflare and performing a
                   search for non-thermal emission (4\{\vphantom{\}}15
                   keV) from nanoflares occurring outside active regions
                   in the quiet Sun. A future spacecraft version of
                   FOXSI, featuring similar optics and detectors, could
                   make detailed observations of HXRs from
                   flare-accelerated electrons, identifying and
                   characterizing particle acceleration sites and
                   mapping out paths of energetic electrons as they
                   leave these sites and propagate throughout the solar
                   corona. This paper will describe the FOXSI instrument
                   and present images from the first flight.},

                   Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket
                   payload. FOXSI has performed the first focused hard
                   X-ray (HXR) observation of the Sun in its first
                   successful flight on 2012 November 2. Focusing
                   optics, combined with small strip detectors, enable
                   high-sensitivity observations with respect to
                   previous indirect imagers. This capability, along
                   with the sensitivity of the HXR regime to
                   high-temperature emission, offers the potential to
                   better characterize high-temperature plasma in the
                   corona as predicted by nanoflare heating models. We
                   present a joint analysis of the differential emission
                   measure (DEM) of active region 11602 using
                   coordinated observations by FOXSI, Hinode/XRT, and
                   Hinode/EIS. The Hinode-derived DEM predicts
                   significant emission measure between 1 MK and 3 MK,
                   with a peak in the DEM predicted at 2.0-2.5 MK. The
                   combined XRT and EIS DEM also shows emission from a
                   smaller population of plasma above 8 MK. This is
                   contradicted by FOXSI observations that significantly
                   constrain emission above 8 MK. This suggests that the
                   Hinode DEM analysis has larger uncertainties at
                   higher temperatures and that {\textgreater} 8 MK
                   plasma above an emission measure of 3 × 1044 cm-3 is
                   excluded in this active region.},

                   4920 arcsec2 (2.58 × 109 km2, more than 60\% of the
                   active region), provides strong evidence for the
                   nanoflare heating model of the solar corona. No GOES
                   events occurred in the region less than 2 hr before

                   north and east of the region with RHESSI and EUNIS

                   velocities anywhere in the region, particularly the
                   microflare, indicates that the pervasive Fe XIX
                   emission is not propelled outward from the microflare
                   site, but is most likely attributed to localized
                   heating (not necessarily due to reconnection)
                   consistent with the nanoflare heating model of the

                   the underlying photosphere, but how the corona
                   attains such high temperatures is still not
                   understood. Soft X-ray (SXR) emission provides
                   important diagnostics for thermal processes in the
                   high-temperature corona, and is also an important
                   driver of ionospheric dynamics at Earth. There is a
                   crucial observational gap between ˜0.2 and ˜4 keV,
                   outside the ranges of existing spectrometers. We
                   present observations from a new SXR spectrometer, the
                   Amptek X123-SDD, which measured the spatially
                   integrated solar spectral irradiance from ˜0.5 to
                   ˜5 keV, with ˜0.15 keV FWHM resolution, during
                   sounding rocket flights on 2012 June 23 and 2013
                   October 21. These measurements show that the highly
                   variable SXR emission is orders of magnitude greater
                   than that during the deep minimum of 2009, even with
                   only weak activity. The observed spectra show
                   significant high-temperature (5-10 MK) emission and
                   are well fit by simple power-law temperature
                   distributions with indices of ˜6, close to the
                   predictions of nanoflare models of coronal heating.
                   Observations during the more active 2013 flight
                   indicate an enrichment of low first-ionization
                   potential elements of only ˜1.6, below the usually
                   observed value of ˜4, suggesting that abundance
                   variations may be related to coronal heating
                   processes. The XUV Photometer System Level 4 data
                   product, a spectral irradiance model derived from
                   integrated broadband measurements, significantly
                   overestimates the spectra from both flights,
                   suggesting a need for revision of its non-flare
                   reference spectra, with important implications for

                   strand is heated by a rapid pulse. However, such fine
                   structure has neither been resolved through direct
                   imaging observations nor conclusively shown through
                   indirect observations of extended superhot plasma.
                   Recently, it has been shown that the observed
                   difference in the appearance of cool and warm coronal
                   loops ({\textasciitilde}1 MK and {\textasciitilde}2-3
                   MK, respectively)—warm loops appearing "fuzzier"
                   than cool loops—can be explained by models of loops
                   composed of subarcsecond strands, which are
                   impulsively heated up to {\textasciitilde}10 MK. That
                   work predicts that images of hot coronal loops (gsim
                   6 MK) should again show fine structure. Here we show
                   that the predicted effect is indeed widely observed
                   in an active region with the Solar Dynamics
                   Observatory, thus supporting a scenario where
                   impulsive heating of fine loop strands plays an
                   important role in powering the active corona.},

                   impulsive heating released at spatial scales smaller
                   than the cross-section of a single loop. We
                   investigate the heating and substructure of coronal
                   loops in the core of one such active region by
                   analyzing the light curves in the smallest resolution
                   elements of solar observations in two EUV channels
                   (94 and 335 Å) from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
                   on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory . We model
                   the evolution of a bundle of strands heated by a
                   storm of nanoflares by means of a hydrodynamic 0D
                   loop model (EB℡). The light curves obtained from a
                   random combination of those of single strands are
                   compared to the observed light curves either in a
                   single pixel or in a row of pixels, simultaneously in
                   the two channels, and using two independent methods:
                   an artificial intelligent system (Probabilistic
                   Neural Network) and a simple cross-correlation
                   technique. We explore the space of the parameters to
                   constrain the distribution of the heat pulses, their
                   duration, their spatial size, and, as a feedback on
                   the data, their signatures on the light curves. From
                   both methods the best agreement is obtained for a
                   relatively large population of events (1000) with a
                   short duration (less than 1 minute) and a relatively
                   shallow distribution (power law with index 1.5) in a
                   limited energy range (1.5 decades). The feedback on
                   the data indicates that bumps in the light curves,
                   especially in the 94 Å channel, are signatures of a
                   heating excess that occurred a few minutes before.},

  abstract =      {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that
                   coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small
                   cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop
                   could contain a hundred or more individual strands
                   that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It
                   is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an
                   entire active region or the global corona.
                   Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial
                   resolution, and one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic
                   codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of
                   elemental strands that must be treated in a
                   reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal
                   conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma
                   gradients along the magnetic field, so
                   zero-dimensional (0D) models are an acceptable
                   alternative. We have developed a highly efficient
                   model called ``enthalpy-based thermal evolution of
                   loops'' (EBTEL), which accurately describes the
                   evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and
                   density along a coronal strand. It improves
                   significantly on earlier models of this type-in
                   accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both
                   slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating;
                   it provides the time-dependent differential emission
                   measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition
                   region footpoints; and there are options for heat
                   flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating.
                   EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more
                   sophisticated 1D hydrodynamic simulations despite
                   using 4 orders of magnitude less computing time. It
                   promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and

                   range of magnitudes using one-dimensional
                   hydrodynamic simulations. It is demonstrated that the
                   principal effect of inadequate resolution is on the
                   coronal density. An underresolved loop typically has
                   a peak density of at least a factor of two lower than
                   a resolved loop subject to the same heating, with
                   larger discrepancies in the decay phase. The
                   temperature for underresolved loops is also lower
                   indicating that lack of resolution does not "bottle
                   up" the heat flux in the corona. Energy is conserved
                   in the models to under 1\% in all cases, indicating
                   that this is not responsible for the low density.
                   Instead, we argue that in underresolved loops the
                   heat flux "jumps across" the transition region to the
                   dense chromosphere from which it is radiated rather
                   than heating and ablating transition region plasma.
                   This emphasizes the point that the interaction
                   between corona and chromosphere occurs only through
                   the medium of the transition region. Implications for

                   evolving coronal heating, especially impulsive
                   heating events. The basis of EBTEL is the modeling of
                   mass exchange between the corona and transition
                   region (TR) and chromosphere in response to heating
                   variations, with the key parameter being the ratio of
                   the TR to coronal radiation. We develop new models

                   stratification and a physically motivated approach to

                   simple and quick way to study the thermal evolution
                   of coronal loops subjected to time-dependent heating.
                   This paper presents a comparison of a number of 0D
                   models that have been published in the past and is
                   intended to provide a guide for those interested in
                   either using the old models or developing new ones.
                   The principal difference between the models is the
                   way the exchange of mass and energy between corona,
                   transition region, and chromosphere is treated, as
                   plasma cycles into and out of a loop during a
                   heating-cooling cycle. It is shown that models based
                   on the principles of mass and energy conservation can
                   give satisfactory results at some or, in the case of

                   can have significant difficulties in obtaining
                   accurate behavior due to invocation of assumptions
                   incompatible with the correct exchange of mass and
                   energy between corona, transition region, and

                   strands or sub-loops heated by small, impulsive
                   events (nanoflares), it is suggested that (i) the

                   These imply small heating events in a stressed

                   individual nanoflares on a strand is of order the

                   that require long energy build-up (over 10 s of

                   To investigate the impact of the spatial distribution
                   of the nanoflare heating on loop observables, we
                   compute hydrodynamic simulations with several
                   different spatial distributions (uniform, loop top,
                   randomly localized, and footpoint). The outputs of
                   the simulations are then used to calculate density
                   and temperature diagnostics from synthetic TRACE and
                   SXT observations. We find that the diagnostics depend
                   only weakly on the spatial distribution of the
                   heating and therefore are not especially useful for
                   distinguishing among the different possibilities.
                   Observations of the very high temperature plasmas
                   that are present only in the earliest stages of
                   nanoflares can shed more light on the field-aligned

  abstract =      {Recently, we suggested that the source of ion heating
                   in solar coronal holes is small-scale reconnection
                   events (microflares) at the coronal base. The
                   microflares launch intermittent heat flux up into the
                   corona exciting ion cyclotron waves through a plasma
                   microinstability. The ions are heated by these waves
                   during the microflare bursts and then evolve with no
                   energy input between the bursts. In this paper, we
                   show that the structure of the proton distribution in
                   the relatively long time periods between the
                   microflares is determined by collisions at small
                   heliocentric distances. At greater distances, the
                   collisional processes can be replaced by similar
                   processes due to secondary instabilities. These are
                   excited by the distortion of the distribution under
                   the action of the mirror force. At the same time, the
                   heating during the microflare bursts is not affected
                   by either the collisions or the secondary
                   instabilities because of the short duration of the
                   bursts. We demonstrate that in each intermittent
                   heating event the protons diffuse approximately along
                   one-dimensional curves in the phase space and can
                   develop a quasi-plateau. The corresponding
                   temperature increase can then be calculated without
                   solving the diffusion equations. The overall coronal
                   heating by this mechanism is a summed effect of all
                   microflare bursts during the expansion time of the
                   solar wind and adiabatic cooling between the
                   microflares. The calculations for the
                   collision-dominated region suggest that the overall
                   heating is efficient enough to account for the
                   acceleration of the fast solar wind in this region.},

                   Heating parallel to the local magnetic field during
                   reconnection with a guide field is strongly reduced
                   compared with the reconnection of anti-parallel
                   magnetic fields. The dominant heating of thermal ions
                   during guide field reconnection results from pickup
                   behavior of ions during their entry into reconnection
                   exhausts and dominantly produces heating
                   perpendicular rather than parallel to the local
                   magnetic field. Pickup behavior requires that the ion
                   transit time across the exhaust boundary (with a
                   transverse scale of the order of the ion sound Larmor
                   radius) be short compared with the ion cyclotron
                   period. This translates into a threshold in the
                   strength of reconnecting magnetic field that favors
                   the heating of ions with high mass-to-charge. A
                   simulation with a broad initial current layer
                   produces a reconnecting system in which the amplitude
                   of the reconnecting magnetic field just upstream of
                   the dissipation region increases with time as
                   reconnection proceeds. The sharp onset of
                   perpendicular heating when the pickup threshold is
                   crossed is documented. A comparison of the time
                   variation of the parallel and perpendicular ion
                   heating with that predicted based on the strength of
                   the reconnecting field establishes the scaling of ion

                   simple physical insights into the system and use a
                   one dimensional hydrodynamic model that treats the
                   electrons and ions as a coupled fluid to simulate
                   nanoflare heating with time-scales of 30 s. Our
                   analytical model also provide a means of verifying
                   our numerical results. Results: .We find that diffuse
                   loops containing plasma at T{\textgreater} 20 MK can
                   be rapidly created and subsequently filled by the
                   violent evaporation of chromospheric plasma driven by
                   near-saturated thermal conduction. Most importantly,
                   we find order-of-magnitude departures from
                   equilibrium of the ionisation balance for iron and
                   use this result to identify a potential signature of
                   this heating mechanism. Conclusions: .We conclude
                   that nanoflare heating can account for the presence
                   of extremely high temperature plasma in a corona with
                   low filling factor. We find that near-saturated
                   thermal conduction may play a key role at the onset
                   of chromospheric evaporation and a non-equilibrium
                   ionisation balance is absolutely inevitable. The high
                   temperatures could never be directly measured in the
                   corona due to the small emission measure and the most
                   promising signature of such heating is blue-shifted
                   plasma from the loop footpoints. We find reason for
                   cautious optimism that this signature can be detected
                   by future space-based spectroscopic instrumentation
                   (e.g. SolarB-EIS).},

                   of the order of 10 MK. Such hot plasma is hardly
                   detected in quiet and active regions, outside flares.
                   During rapid and short heat pulses in rarefied loops,
                   the plasma can be highly out of equilibrium in
                   ionization. Here we investigate the effects of the
                   nonequilibrium of ionization (NEI) on the detection
                   of hot plasma in coronal loops. Time-dependent loop
                   hydrodynamic simulations are specifically devoted to
                   this task, including saturated thermal conduction,
                   and coupled to the detailed solution of the equations
                   of the ionization rate for several abundant elements.
                   In our simulations, initially cool and rarefied
                   magnetic flux tubes are heated to 10 MK by nanoflares
                   deposited either at the footpoints or at the loop
                   apex. We test for different pulse durations and find
                   that, due to NEI effects, the loop plasma may never
                   be detected at temperatures above {\textasciitilde}5

  abstract =      {Context: The effects of non-equilibrium processes on
                   the ionisation state of strongly emitting elements in
                   the solar corona can be extremely difficult to assess
                   and yet they are critically important. For example,
                   there is much interest in dynamic heating events
                   localised in the solar corona because they are
                   believed to be responsible for its high temperature
                   and yet recent work has shown that the hottest
                   (≥107 K) emission predicted to be associated with
                   these events can be observationally elusive due to
                   the difficulty of creating the highly ionised states
                   from which the expected emission arises. This leads
                   to the possibility of observing instruments missing
                   such heating events entirely. Aims: The equations
                   describing the evolution of the ionisaton state are a
                   very stiff system of coupled, partial differential
                   equations whose solution can be numerically
                   challenging and time-consuming. Without access to
                   specialised codes and significant computational
                   resources it is extremely difficult to avoid the
                   assumption of an equilibrium ionisation state even
                   when it clearly cannot be justified. The aim of the
                   current work is to develop a computational tool to
                   allow straightforward calculation of the
                   time-dependent ionisation state for a wide variety of
                   physical circumstances. Methods: A numerical model
                   comprising the system of time-dependent ionisation
                   equations for a particular element and tabulated
                   values of plasma temperature as a function of time is
                   developed. The tabulated values can be the solutions
                   of an analytical model, the output from a numerical
                   code or a set of observational measurements. An
                   efficient numerical method to solve the ionisation
                   equations is implemented. Results: A suite of tests
                   is designed and run to demonstrate that the code
                   provides reliable and accurate solutions for a number
                   of scenarios including equilibration of the ion
                   population and rapid heating followed by thermal
                   conductive cooling. It is found that the solver can
                   evolve the ionisation state to recover exactly the
                   equilibrium state found by an independent,
                   steady-state solver for all temperatures, resolve the
                   extremely small ionisation/recombination timescales
                   associated with rapid temperature changes at high
                   densities, and provide stable and accurate solutions
                   for both dominant and minor ion population fractions.
                   Rapid heating and cooling of low to moderate density
                   plasma is characterised by significant
                   non-equilibrium ionisation conditions. The effective
                   ionisation temperatures are significantly lower than
                   the electron temperature and the values found are in
                   close agreement with the previous work of others. At
                   the very highest densities included in the present
                   study an assumption of equilibrium ionisation is
                   found to be robust. Conclusions: The computational
                   tool presented here provides a straightforward and
                   reliable way to calculate ionisation states for a
                   wide variety of physical circumstances. The numerical
                   code gives results that are accurate and consistent
                   with previous studies, has relatively undemanding
                   computational requirements and is freely available

                   coronal loop is assumed to consist of many small
                   strands that cannot be distinguished spatially by EUV
                   or X-ray observations, we are able to calculate
                   differential emission-measure profiles and filling
                   factors for a range of heating models. In this
                   picture the strands undergo continual heating and
                   cooling, leading to a corona comprising strands with
                   a broad range of temperatures and densities. Thus,
                   observations over a range of temperatures will show a
                   multithermal coronal structure. The cyclical
                   heating-cooling leads inevitably to loops that are
                   underdense and overdense at high and low
                   temperatures, respectively, compared to what would be
                   expected from static equilibrium models, and in
                   addition, we show that differential emission-measure
                   profiles with shallow slopes can be obtained, as
                   reported in recent observations. The differences
                   between filling factors that can be seen by broadband
                   and narrowband instruments are explored. Loops with
                   broadband filling factors near unity can still have
                   small narrowband factors, and the narrowband factor
                   is shown to be a strong function of the local
                   temperature. Nanoflare energy distributions that are
                   constant, flat, or power laws are considered. Power
                   laws lead to wide distributions of temperatures and
                   densities in the corona, and steep power laws lead to
                   larger filling factors.},

                   core (with evidence of super-hot plasma) and those
                   predicted from a model with a random combination of
                   many pulse-heated strands with a power-law energy
                   distribution. We extend that work by including
                   spatially resolved strand modeling and by studying
                   the evolution of emission along the loops in the EUV
                   94 Å and 335 Å channels of the Atmospheric Imaging
                   Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
                   Using the best parameters of the previous work as the
                   input of the present one, we find that the amplitude
                   of the random fluctuations driven by the random heat
                   pulses increases from the bottom to the top of the
                   loop in the 94 Å channel and from the top to the
                   bottom in the 335 Å channel. This prediction is
                   confirmed by the observation of a set of aligned
                   neighboring pixels along a bright arc of an active
                   region core. Maps of pixel fluctuations may therefore
                   provide easy diagnostics of nanoflaring regions.},
